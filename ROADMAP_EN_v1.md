Security statement
This document is strictly a funding roadmap and review workflow. It intentionally does not publish any technical, operational, or step‑by‑step details for circumventing censorship.

About the author
This document was prepared by Tawana Mohammadi. Tawana is a researcher and instructor in artificial intelligence and an advocate for digital rights. The Tawanavpn / Tawana Proxy project aims to improve free and secure internet access for Iranian users, with particular support for journalists and civil society actors. This section is for public introduction only and contains no technical or operational details. This roadmap reflects ongoing work in ethical, user‑safety‑centered internet‑freedom tooling.

Executive summary
This roadmap outlines potential funding pathways and the OTF IFF review workflow for the Tawanavpn project. Version 1.0 is a public starting point. The document is a living resource and will be updated regularly (weekly or phase‑based) as the project advances. Each update will include progress reports, lists of sanitized public tools and scripts, and links to high‑level documentation. Public release of repositories will occur only after sanitization review to ensure no operationally sensitive material is published. All public outputs described here are intended to be openly licensed after sanitization review.

1) Funding sources — categorized

This section groups likely funding sources by purpose and project stage. The list is intended as a public overview; none of the entries include operational or sensitive guidance.

A) Main development grants
Suited for technical development, open-source releases, and ecosystem-oriented outputs.

- OTF — Internet Freedom Fund (IFF)
  - Primary route for concept proposals that demonstrate technical innovation and a plan for stable, open-source delivery.

- DRL — Internet Freedom Program (U.S. Department of State)
  - Larger-scale development grants for circumvention and digital security tools; appropriate when a prototype exists and scaling is required.

- Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — Freedom Tech / Development Funds
  - Support for privacy, anti-censorship, and open-source projects with global community impact.

B) Scale & operations funding
Intended to cover operational costs when user base and infrastructure demands grow.

- OTF — Surge & Sustain Fund
  - Support for established tools facing high traffic and infrastructure costs; covers capacity and service reliability needs.

C) Emergency / rapid response funding
For immediate needs during crises such as intensified blocking, large-scale attacks, or major connectivity outages.

- OTF — Rapid Response Fund
  - Flexible, fast support for urgent needs (e.g., infrastructure, emergency mitigation).

- Digital Defenders Partnership (DDP) — Incident Response / Emergency Fund
  - Short-term emergency support, typically smaller in scale, for recent incidents.

- Access Now — Digital Security Helpline
  - Technical and security advice and support in urgent situations (not typically a large grant source).

- Front Line Defenders — Protection Grants
  - Emergency protection support for at-risk individuals; relevant when project activities are tied to protecting people.

- Lifeline (Freedom House / partners)
  - Short-term emergency support for organizations and networks under pressure.

D) Alternative and complementary sources
- Alternative Sources of Support (as listed by OTF)
  - A curated list of additional funders and support mechanisms recommended by OTF for similar projects.

2) OTF / IFF review workflow — stages and meaning

Typical stages from concept submission to final determination:

1. Draft
   - Internal pre-submission draft.

2. Concept Note Received
   - Concept note submitted and entered into the review queue.

3. OTF Review (Concept)
   - OTF performs an internal assessment of the concept note.

4. Dismissed
   - Concept is declined at the concept stage (e.g., insufficient detail, misalignment).

5. Invited for Proposal
   - Concept accepted; applicant invited to submit a full proposal.

6. Proposal Received
   - Full proposal submitted and logged.

7. OTF Review (Proposal)
   - Internal, detailed review of the full proposal.

8. External Review
   - Independent reviewers or external experts evaluate the proposal.

9. Final Determination
   - Decision point: award (grant/contract) or rejection.

Notes
- At any stage OTF may request clarifications or additional materials. Clear documentation of innovation, impact, and ecosystem contribution strengthens proposals.
- Timelines vary depending on submission volumes and program priorities.

3) Current project status in this roadmap

Previous submission
- Category: Technology Development
- Maturity: Early concept (limited detail)
- Reason for dismissal: Insufficient clarity on the project's distinct innovation and ecosystem usage.

Current submission (updated)
- Category: Technology Development + Shutdown-Resilience + DPI Resistance
- Maturity: Prototype / Proof-of-Concept with initial field tests
- Key advantages for funders:
  - Multi-layered architecture prioritizing resilience during connectivity shutdowns
  - Approaches that reduce dependence on centralized infrastructure
  - Outputs designed for documentation and wider ecosystem adoption

Recommended next steps
- Clarify the novel elements and compare them directly to existing solutions to demonstrate unique value.
- Consolidate field evidence from PoC testing and provide a clear timeline for development and scaling.
- Prepare a complete proposal following OTF templates, with focused sections on risk mitigation and sustainability.

Closing summary
This roadmap is an initial, public-facing document intended to clarify funding paths and the review process. It is deliberately non-technical and non-operational. The project is active and evolving; subsequent releases will publish sanitized public progress updates and high-level documentation suitable for funders and reviewers.

Note: This roadmap will be updated as the project progresses.
